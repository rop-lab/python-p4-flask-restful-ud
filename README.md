# Update and Delete with Flask-RESTful

## Learning Goals

- Build RESTful APIs that are easy to navigate and use in applications.

---

## Key Vocab

- **Representational State Transfer (REST)**: a convention for developing
  applications that use HTTP in a consistent, human-readable, machine-readable
  way.
- **Application Programming Interface (API)**: a software application that
  allows two or more software applications to communicate with one another. Can
  be standalone or incorporated into a larger product.
- **HTTP Request Method**: assets of HTTP requests that tell the server which
  actions the client is attempting to perform on the located resource.
- **`GET`**: the most common HTTP request method. Signifies that the client is
  attempting to view the located resource.
- **`POST`**: the second most common HTTP request method. Signifies that the
  client is attempting to submit a form to create a new resource.
- **`PATCH`**: an HTTP request method that signifies that the client is
  attempting to update a resource with new information.
- **`PUT`**: an HTTP request method that signifies that the client is attempting
  to update a resource with new information contained in a complete record.
- **`DELETE`**: an HTTP request method that signifies that the client is
  attempting to delete a resource.

## Introduction

Now that we've explored how to create and retrieve records with `POST` and
`GET`, let's look into updating records individually and in batches with
`PATCH`.

Run `pipenv install && pipenv shell` to enter your virtual environment.

```console
$ pipenv install && pipenv shell
```

Change into the `server` directory to create the database and populate it with
seed data:

```console
$ cd server
$ flask db upgrade
$ python seed.py
```

## Adding a `PATCH` Route

We're just about pros with Flask-RESTful now: if you're feeling confident, go
ahead and try adding a `patch()` method to `NewsletterByID`.

> \*\*TIP: Remember to use `setattr()` to cut down the number of lines of code!

Solution below...

Just as with the `get()` route in this resource, we're going to pass in the `id`
from the URL and use it to retrieve the record we're updating. Unlike the
`get()` route, we want to leave it as a `Newsletter` object instead of
converting it to a dictionary, since we want to change the attributes on the
record.

```py
# server/app.py

class NewsletterByID(Resource):

    # get()

    def patch(self, id):

        record = Newsletter.query.filter(Newsletter.id == id).first()
        for attr in request.form:
            setattr(record, attr, request.form[attr])

        db.session.add(record)
        db.session.commit()

        response_dict = record.to_dict()

        response = make_response(
            response_dict,
            200
        )

        return response
```

Looping through the form data gives us its keys, the attribute names to be
changed. From there, we can set each attribute on the `Newsletter` object to its
new value with `setattr()`. From here, we update the database with the new
record, create a response with the record, and send it back to the client.

Try it out for yourself: open Postman and navigate to
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/newsletters/20](http://127.0.0.1:5000/newsletters/20).
Change the request method to `PATCH`, edit the `Body > form-data` with a new
body, then hit submit. You should see a response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "body": "blah blah blah blah blah blah blah",
  "edited_at": "2022-09-22 16:50:06",
  "id": 20,
  "published_at": "2022-09-22 16:48:12",
  "title": "Mr. Title"
}
```

Looks like someone didn't enjoy the newsletter from September 22!

## Adding a `DELETE` Route

Now that we've identified an unpopular newsletter, it might be a good idea to
head into the API and delete it. To accomplish that, we'll have to add a
`delete()` route to `NewsletterByID`:

```py
# server/app.py

class NewsletterByID(Resource):

    # get(), patch()

    def delete(self, id):

        record = Newsletter.query.filter(Newsletter.id == id).first()

        db.session.delete(record)
        db.session.commit()

        response_dict = {"message": "record successfully deleted"}

        response = make_response(
            response_dict,
            200
        )

        return response
```

Here, we retrieve the record using the `id` passed to the route through the URL,
delete it, and return a message that the record has been successfully deleted:

```json
{
  "message": "record successfully deleted"
}
```

## Conclusion

While there are a few nuances that separate Flask-RESTful from vanilla Flask in
building APIs, we can see that they exist to simplify the process of making a
RESTful API: rather than specifying the accepted HTTP request methods and
handling them with `if/elif/else` blocks, methods are used to neatly organize
the routes for `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, and more at each URL.

migrate = Migrate(app, db)
db.init_app(app)

api = Api(app)

class Index(Resource):

        }

        response = make_response(
            response_dict,
            200,

            200,

        )

        db.session.add(new_record)
        db.session.commit()

            response_dict,
            200,
        )

        return response

    def patch(self, id):

        record = Newsletter.query.filter_by(id=id).first()
        for attr in request.form:
            setattr(record, attr, request.form[attr])

        db.session.add(record)
        db.session.commit()

        response_dict = record.to_dict()

        response = make_response(
            response_dict,
            200
        )

        return response

    def delete(self, id):

        record = Newsletter.query.filter_by(id=id).first()

        db.session.delete(record)
        db.session.commit()

        response_dict = {"message": "record successfully deleted"}

        response = make_response(
            response_dict,
            200
        )

        return response

api.add_resource(NewsletterByID, '/newsletters/<int:id>')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5555, debug=True)
